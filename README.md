New web developers are so enthusiastic about the idea of `serverless` and `AWS`. Most of the experienced developers we already know that we shouldn't use these things for our critical parts of our application.


**`Serverless and AWS` Are Wonderful—Until They Go Wrong.**  There was a flash-point (at 28 February of 2017) where the 'internet was offline' and most of the sites, including isitdownrightnow.com,  were down or operated very slow! Why? Because of `serverless` and `AmazonS3`. 
Please think twice before moving your code into `serverless`, **instead, use web frameworks that are created for servers that you control**.

Proof of concept: 

- [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/02/28/why-a-whole-slew-of-websites-are-suddenly-down-or-working-slowly)
- [CNN](http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/28/technology/amazon-web-services-outages/index.html)
- [CNET](https://www.cnet.com/news/no-the-internet-is-not-broken-amazon-web-services-is-just-having-issues/?ftag=COS-05-10-aa0a&linkId=34980800)
- [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603738/centralized-web-services-are-wonderful-until-they-go-wrong/?_ga=1.82562070.1263144274.1488319022)
- [GolangNews](https://golangnews.com/stories/1835-serverless-is-wonderfuluntil-they-go-wrong.)


Iris is fully vendored. That means it is independent of any API changes in the used libraries and **will work seamlessly in the future**!

The size of the executable file is a critical part of the Application Deployment Process.

Two very simple identical applications, the first was written with `iris` and the second with a simple golang router.
 
 - _iris_ had `8.505 KB` overall file size
 - _gin_ had `9.029 KB` overall file size
 - _net/http_ had produced an executable file with `5.380 KB` size.


> Iris has built'n support for the most of the features that you will use to craft your perfect web application, while the golang router(gin & httprouter alone) doesn't. Imagine what would happened if the simple app we created would use `sessions`, `websockets`, `view engine`... I tested that too, `gin` and `net/http` had produced the x3 of their original size, **while `iris application`' overall executable filesize remained stable**!


**Applications that are written using Iris produce smaller file size even if they use more features** than a simple router library!


Iris always follows the latest trends and best practices. Iris is the **Secret To Staying One Step Ahead of Your Competition**.


Iris is **a high-performance** tool, but it doesn't stops there. Performance depends on your application too, **Iris helps you to make the right choices** on every step.

**Familiar** and easy **API**. Sinatra-like REST API.

Contains examples and documentation for all its features.

Iris is a `low-level access` web framework, you always know what you're doing.

You'll **never miss a thing** from `net/http`, but if you do on some point, no problem because Iris is fully compatible with stdlib, you still have access to `http.ResponseWriter` and `http.Request`, you can adapt any third-party middleware of form `func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request, next http.HandlerFunc)` as well.

Iris is a community-driven project, **you suggest and I code**.

Unlike other repositories, this one is **very active**. When you post an issue, you get an answer at the next couple of minutes(hours at the worst). If you find a bug, **I am obliged to fix** that on the same day.

)

func main() {
	// Receives optional iris.Configuration{}, see ./configuration.go
	// for more.
	app := iris.New()

	// Order doesn't matter,
	// You can split it to different .Adapt calls.
	// See ./adaptors folder for more.
	app.Adapt(
		// adapt a logger which prints all errors to the os.Stdout
		iris.DevLogger(),
		// adapt the adaptors/httprouter or adaptors/gorillamux
		httprouter.New(),
		// 5 template engines are supported out-of-the-box:
		//
		// - standard html/template
		// - amber
		// - django
		// - handlebars
		// - pug(jade)
		//
		// Use the html standard engine for all files inside "./views" folder with extension ".html"
		view.HTML("./views", ".html"),
		// Cors wrapper to the entire application, allow all origins.
		cors.New(cors.Options{AllowedOrigins: []string{"*"}}))

	// http://localhost:6300
	// Method: "GET"
	// Render ./views/index.html
	app.Get("/", func(ctx *iris.Context) {
		ctx.Render("index.html", iris.Map{"Title": "Page Title"}, iris.RenderOptions{"gzip": true})
	})

	// Group routes, optionally: share middleware, template layout and custom http errors.
	userAPI := app.Party("/users", userAPIMiddleware).
		Layout("layouts/userLayout.html")
	{
		// Fire userNotFoundHandler when Not Found
		// inside http://localhost:6300/users/*anything
		userAPI.OnError(404, userNotFoundHandler)

		// http://localhost:6300/users

}

func userAPIMiddleware(ctx *iris.Context) {
	// your code here...
	println("Request: " + ctx.Path())
	ctx.Next() // go to the next handler(s)
}

func userNotFoundHandler(ctx *iris.Context) {
	// your code here...

}
```

### Reload on source code changes

```sh
$ go get -u github.com/kataras/rizla
$ cd $GOPATH/src/mywebapp
$ rizla main.go
```

### Reload templates on each incoming request

```go
app.Adapt(view.HTML("./views", ".html").Reload(true))
```


Third Party Middleware
------------

Iris has its own middleware form of `func(ctx *iris.Context)` but it's also compatible with all `net/http` middleware forms using [iris.ToHandler](https://github.com/iris-contrib/middleware/blob/master/cors/cors.go#L33), i.e Negroni's middleware form of `func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, next http.HandlerFunc)`.

Testing
------------

The `httptest` package is a simple Iris helper for the httpexpect, a new library for End-to-end HTTP and REST API testing for Go.

You can find tests by navigating to the source code,
i.e:

- [context_test.go](https://github.com/kataras/iris/blob/v6/context_test.go)
- [handler_test.go](https://github.com/kataras/iris/blob/v6/handler_test.go)
- [policy_gorillamux_test.go](https://github.com/kataras/iris/blob/v6/policy_gorillamux_test.go)
- [policy_httprouter_test.go](https://github.com/kataras/iris/blob/v6/policy_httprouter_test.go)
- [policy_nativerouter_test.go](https://github.com/kataras/iris/blob/v6/policy_nativerouter_test.go)
- [policy_render_test.go](https://github.com/kataras/iris/blob/v6/policy_render_test.go)
- [policy_sessions_test.go](https://github.com/kataras/iris/blob/v6/policy_sessions_test.go)
- [response_writer_test.go](https://github.com/kataras/iris/blob/v6/response_writer_test.go)
- [route_test.go](https://github.com/kataras/iris/blob/v6/route_test.go)
- [status_test.go](https://github.com/kataras/iris/blob/v6/status_test.go)
- [transaction_test.go](https://github.com/kataras/iris/blob/v6/transaction_test.go)

A simple test is located to [./httptest/_example/main_test.go](https://github.com/kataras/iris/blob/v6/httptest/_example/main_test.go)

httpexpect's repository has some Iris examples too:

- https://github.com/gavv/httpexpect/blob/master/_examples/iris.go (without `httptest` package)
- https://github.com/gavv/httpexpect/blob/master/_examples/iris_test.go (without `httptest` package)

Read more about httpexpect [here](https://github.com/gavv/httpexpect).


Philosophy
------------

The Iris philosophy is to provide robust tooling for HTTP, making it a great solution for single page applications, web sites, hybrids, or public HTTP APIs. Keep note that, today, iris is faster than nginx itself.

Iris does not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine. Iris is routerless which means you can adapt any router you like, [httprouter](https://github.com/kataras/iris/blob/v6/adaptors/httprouter/_example/main.go) is the fastest, [gorillamux](https://github.com/kataras/iris/blob/v6/adaptors/gorillamux/_example/main.go) has more features. With support for the most used template engines (5), you can quickly craft the perfect application.

The Success of Iris belongs to YOU with your bug reports and feature requests that made this Framework so Unique.

#### Who is kataras?

Hi, my name is Gerasimos Maropoulos and I'm the author of this project, let me put a few words about me.

I started to design Iris the night of the 13 March 2016, some weeks later, iris started to became famous and I have to fix many issues and implement new features, but I didn't have time to work on Iris because I had a part time job and the (software engineering) colleague which I studied.

I wanted to make iris' users proud of the framework they're using, so I decided to interrupt my studies and colleague, two days later I left from my part time job also.

Today I spend all my days and nights coding for Iris, and I'm happy about this, therefore I have zero incoming value.

- Star the project, will help you to follow the upcoming features.
- [Donate](https://github.com/kataras/iris/blob/master/DONATIONS.md), if you can afford any cost.
- Write an article about Iris or even post a Tweet.
- **Do Pull Requests on the [iris-contrib](https://github.com/iris-contrib)** organisation's repositories, like [book](https://github.com/iris-contrib/gitbook), [examples](https://github.com/iris-contrib/examples) and to [gopherbook](http://gopherbook.iris-go.com/).
