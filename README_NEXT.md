Iris is a fast, simple and efficient micro web framework for Go. It provides a beautifully expressive and easy to use foundation for your next website, API, or distributed app.

We have no doubt you will able to find other web frameworks written in Go
and even put up a real fight to learn and use them for quite some time but
make no mistake, sooner or later you will be using Iris, not because of the ergonomic, high-performant solution that it provides but its well-documented unique features, as these will transform you to a real rockstar geek. 

No matter what you're trying to build, Iris covers 
every type of application, from micro services to large monolithic web applications.
It's actually the best piece of software for back-end web developers
you can find online.

Iris may have reached version 8, but we're not stopping there. We have many feature ideas on our board that we're anxious to add and other innovative web development solutions that we're planning to build into Iris.

Iris was built on top of the the [net/http](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/) package, we own many thanks to [Brad Fitzpatrick](https://github.com/bradfitz) for that.

If you're coming from <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> world, this is the <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/express">expressjs</a> equivalent for the <a href="https://golang.org">Go Programming Language.</a><br/>

**Accelerated** by [KeyCDN](https://www.keycdn.com/), A Simple, Fast and Reliable CDN.

**We are developing** this project using the best code editor for Golang; [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) supported by [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com).

### 🚀 Installation

The only requirement is the [Go Programming Language](https://golang.org/dl/), at least version 1.8, but **1.9** is highly recommended. [Docs](https://docs.iris-go.com) and [Examples](_examples) are written using the go 1.9 version.

```sh
$ go get -u github.com/kataras/iris
```

> _iris_ takes advantage of the [vendor directory](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bz5-UB7g2uPBdOx-rw5t9MxJwkfpx90cqG9AFL0JAYo) feature. You get truly reproducible builds, as this method guards against upstream renames and deletes.

```go
// file: main.go
package main
import "github.com/kataras/iris"

func main() {
    app := iris.New()
    // Load all templates from the "./views" folder
    // where extension is ".html" and parse them
    // using the standard `html/template` package.
    app.RegisterView(iris.HTML("./views", ".html"))

    // Method:    GET
    // Resource:  http://localhost:8080
    app.Get("/", func(ctx iris.Context) {
        // Bind: {{.message}} with "Hello world!"
        ctx.ViewData("message", "Hello world!")
        // Render template file: ./views/hello.html
        ctx.View("hello.html")
    })

    // Method:    GET
    // Resource:  http://localhost:8080/user/42
    //
    // Need to use a custom regexp instead?
    // Easy;
    // Just mark the parameter's type to 'string'
    // which accepts anything and make use of
    // its `regexp` macro function, i.e:
    // app.Get("/user/{id:string regexp(^[0-9]+$)}")
    app.Get("/user/{id:long}", func(ctx iris.Context) {
        userID, _ := ctx.Params().GetInt64("id")
        ctx.Writef("User ID: %d", userID)
    })

    // Start the server using a network address.
    app.Run(iris.Addr(":8080"))
}
```

> See all available path parameter types at: https://github.com/kataras/iris/blob/master/_examples/routing/dynamic-path/main.go#L31

```html
<!-- file: ./views/hello.html -->
<html>
<head>
    <title>Hello Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>{{.message}}</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

```sh 
$ go run main.go
> Now listening on: http://localhost:8080
> Application started. Press CTRL+C to shut down.
```

> Examples and docs are updated to Go 1.9, please refer to that [section](https://github.com/kataras/iris/blob/master/faq.md#type-aliases) before anything else.

<details>
<summary>Hello World with Go 1.8</summary>

Iris declares all of its type alias at the same file in order to be easy to be discovered. 

> If you just upgraded to go 1.9 from 1.8 you can always search for a compatible type alias at the [context.go](context.go) file and opposite, if you use go 1.8 and you're new to Iris you can see [that](context.go) file to see the compatible packages. 

If Go 1.8 remains the basic host for your go apps then you should declare and use the `github.com/kataras/iris/context` package on your source file's imports statement.

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/kataras/iris"
    "github.com/kataras/iris/context"
)

func main() {
    app := iris.New()
    app.RegisterView(iris.HTML("./templates", ".html"))

    app.Get("/", func(ctx context.Context) {
        ctx.ViewData("message", "Hello world!")
        ctx.View("hello.html")
    })

    app.Run(iris.Addr(":8080"))
}
```

<summary>Fan of the MVC Architectural Pattern? Click here</summary>

```go
package main

import "github.com/kataras/iris"

func main() {
    app := iris.New()
    app.RegisterView(iris.HTML("./views", ".html"))

    app.Controller("/", new(Controller))

    app.Run(iris.Addr(":8080"))
}

type Controller struct {
    iris.Controller
}

// Method:    GET
// Resource:  http://localhost:8080
func (c *Controller) Get() {
    c.Data["message"] = "Hello world!"
    c.Tmpl = "hello.html"
}

// Method:    GET
// Resource:  http://localhost:8080/user/42
func (c *Controller) GetUserBy(id int64) {
    c.Ctx.Writef("User ID: %d", id)
}
```

<summary>Why a new web framework</summary>

### Why

Go is a great technology stack for building scalable, web-based, back-end systems for web 
applications. 

When you think about building web applications and web APIs, or simply building HTTP servers in Go, does your mind go to the standard net/http package?
Then you have to deal with some common situations like dynamic routing (a.k.a parameterized), security and authentication, real-time communication and many other issues that net/http doesn't solve. 

The net/http package is not complete enough to quickly build well-designed back-end web systems. When you realize this, you might be thinking along these lines:

- Ok, the net/http package doesn't suit me, but there are so many frameworks, which one will work for me?!
- Each one of them tells me that it is the best. I don't know what to do!

##### The truth

I did some deep research and benchmarks with 'wrk' and 'ab' in order to choose which framework would suit me and my new project. The results, sadly, were really disappointing to me.

I started wondering if golang wasn't as fast on the web as I had read... but, before I let Golang go and continued to develop with nodejs, I told myself:

> '**Makis, don't lose hope, give at least a chance to Golang. Try to build something totally new without basing it off the "slow" code you saw earlier; learn the secrets of this language and make *others* follow your steps!**'.

These are the words I told myself that day [**13 March 2016**]. 

The same day, later the night, I was reading a book about Greek mythology. I saw an ancient goddess' name and was inspired immediately to give a name to this new web framework (which I had already started writing) - **Iris**.

 I'm still here [because Iris has succeed in being the fastest go web framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smallnest/go-web-framework-benchmark/4db507a22c964c9bc9774c5b31afdc199a0fe8b7/benchmark.png)

----

_iris_ is easy, it has a familiar API while in the same has far more features than [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) or [Martini](https://github.com/go-martini/martini).

You own your code —it will never generate (unfamiliar) code for you, like [Beego](https://github.com/astaxie/beego), [Revel](https://github.com/revel/revel) and [Buffalo](https://github.com/gobuffalo/buffalo) do.

It's not just-another-router but its overall performance is equivalent with something like [httprouter](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter).

Unlike [fasthttp](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp), iris provides full HTTP/2 support for free.
