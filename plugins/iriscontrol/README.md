## Iris Control

This plugin will give you remotely ( and local ) access to your iris server's information via a web interface


### Assets
No assets here because this is go -getable folder I don't want to messup with the folder size, in order to solve this 
I created a downloader manager inside this package which downloads the first time the assets and unzip them to the kataras/iris/plugins/iris-control/iris-control-assets/ .



The assets files are inside [this repository](https://github.com/iris-contrib/iris-control-assets)
